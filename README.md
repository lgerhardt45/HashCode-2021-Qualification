# HashCode-2021-Qualification


Team *Jointify* (github.com/lgerhardt45/Jointify) is back at it again and wants to claim the [HashCode 2021 Munich Hub crown](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode). We truly enjoyed our first insights into competitive coding and were happy to end up with >7.000.000 points on the scoreboard!

Thanks a lot to
